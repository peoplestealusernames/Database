# Database (archive branch)
This is a archive of the database code when it only used custom enrcypted TCP sockets.
A very much WIP version of the code however I swapped the code to wss and https using a proxy so a overhaul was needed.
As such this is the old database code.

It only serves as a get put and listen to a database via tcp sockets.
